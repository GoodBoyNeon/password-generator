## Process

First of all, please donot make pull requests without any issues linked to it. If you find a bug or field of improvement for the code which doesn't have an issue yet, refer to creating a new issue and make a pr corresponding to the issue. There isn't much requirements or rules for making a issue but please donot make issues about non-logical stuff.
