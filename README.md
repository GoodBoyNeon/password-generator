# [Random Password Generator](https://goodboyneon.github.io/passwordGenerator/)

This is a simple random password generator made with javacript. You can clone this repository and use it to generate random passwords via your browser. Note that this is a practice project by me so there might be many fields of improvement but I did as good I possibly could. You can add prs (pull requests) to this repository if you have any suggestions. The complte process can be found on [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/GoodBoyNeon/passwordGenerator/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) page.

## Installation

There is no package required to use this project. You can simply download the project and run it. Note that the clipboard icon requires a fontawesome kit url. For the icon to work, you need to add the following to the head tag:

```html
  <script src="kit-url-here" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
Then you can simply run the file and the project should work fine as long as you don't make code breaking changes.
